	* ChangeLog: Another crack at 1.40

2009-04-30 22:10  rbt

	* Makefile: make release was broken.

2009-04-30 22:09  rbt

	* ChangeLog: Release notes for 1.40

2009-04-26 13:01  rbt

	* postgresql_autodoc.pl: Don't need relhasindexes, relhasrules, or
	  relhastriggers since older DBs have been dropped. This also makes
	  up 8.4 compatible without additional changes required.

2009-04-24 00:43  rbt

	* postgresql_autodoc.pl: Improve wording for --table help (Jamie
	  Nicholson)

2009-04-24 00:41  rbt

	* postgresql_autodoc.pl: Add -m <regex> to only output structures
	  or functions matching a specific regex (Simon Michael)

	  Tidy code along the way.

2009-04-24 00:21  rbt

	* postgresql_autodoc.pl: Remove support for PostgreSQL versions
	  earlier than 8.0.

	  Do a better job of named function parameters.

2009-04-24 00:04  rbt

	* postgresql_autodoc.pl: Minor fixes for named functions for newer
	  DBD::Pg's. A long time ago DBD::Pg changed from returning an
	  array string to returning an actual array for PostgreSQL arrays.
	  Autodoc did not take this into account.

2009-04-23 23:46  rbt

	* Makefile, config.mk.in, configure.ac: Dramatically simplify
	  installation process (Thanks Simon Bertrang).

	  Complex installation checks have never been required so drop it
	  and replace with simple make functionality.

	  Targetting to a different installation prefix is done by setting
	  the PREFIX variable:

	  make PREFIX=/some/new/home install

2009-04-23 23:39  rbt

	* config.mk.in: Use datarootdir instead of datadir

2008-03-16 19:30  rbt

	* ChangeLog: 1.31 actual

2008-03-12 15:00  rbt

	* postgresql_autodoc.pl: Clean up formatting.

2008-03-12 15:00  rbt

	* postgresql_autodoc.pl: Do not output all functions in the
	  database if a specific table list was requested. Good chance it
	  isn't functions the user is after.

2008-03-12 14:55  rbt

	* postgresql_autodoc.pl: Keep foreign key defaults (0) when
	  referencing a table which does not exist in our output.

2008-03-12 14:50  rbt

	* postgresql_autodoc.pl: Leonardo Cezar patches:

	  One of them to fix a odd behavior when we had views in schema to
	  schema to extract some reporter.  Previously we got an error on
	  trying to get statistcs from a view, since views hasn't stats.

	  The other one to choose which table(s) we want to collect
	  information with --table=foo,bar,x ... option.

	  Although it's functional we still get warning when dealing with
	  table FKs that weren't selected together; among others gotchas
	  ;-).

	  Unfortunately I didn't find any mailing lists or forum to treat
	  this issue neither at pgfoundry nor autodoc's website.  --

	  FKeys still unfixed.	Statistics portion cleaned up by me.
	  Virtually no testing of input for comma separated values but oh
	  well.

	  Will follow with a fix to all the "gotchas"

2008-03-12 14:24  rbt

	* ChangeLog, postgresql_autodoc.pl: Tag for 1.31 release. After
	  additional testing to ensure Foriegn Keys work again this is what
	  will go out.

2008-03-12 14:21  rbt

	* postgresql_autodoc.pl: New versions of DBD::Pg like to return an
	  array reference instead of the special text string that
	  PostgreSQL returns.

	  This might take care of the issue, although only partially tested
	  (FreeBSD ports doesn't have the newer version yet as it breaks a
	  number of applications).

2007-01-02 09:44  rbt

	* ChangeLog: Release 1.30

2007-01-02 08:53  rbt

	* configure.ac, postgresql_autodoc.pl: Toshio Kuratomi wrote a
	  patch to allow a password to be provided via prompt.

2006-05-16 15:01  rbt

	* html.tmpl, postgresql_autodoc.pl, xml.tmpl: Assume the strings
	  are in UTF8 instead of in ASCII. This expands on the number of
	  characters that we can work with. While not perfect, it is an
	  improvement.

	  Submitted by:   Dirk Jagdmann

2006-05-16 14:58  rbt

	* config.mk.in: The datadir should be
	  /usr/local/share/postgresql_autodoc by default instead of
	  /usr/local/share.

	  Submitted by:   Dirk Jagdmann

2006-05-16 14:57  rbt

	* Makefile: Add an uninstall target.

	  Submitted by:   Dirk Jagdmann

2006-03-17 17:32  rbt

	* postgresql_autodoc.pl: Do not prepare() the statistics query if
	  it is not going to be used.

	  Prepare() and finish() on an empty string causes DBD::Pg to
	  complain about the finish().

2006-02-12 20:15  rbt

	* html.tmpl, postgresql_autodoc.pl, regressdatabase.sql: Add in
	  very simple inheritance documentation. Templates other than HTML
	  need to be updated.

	  Remove support for PostgreSQL 7.1 and 7.2. Continues to support
	  7.3 and later.

2006-02-12 15:27  rbt

	* html.tmpl: Display index information in HTML output.

2005-05-02 22:18  rbt

	* ChangeLog: Changelog for the 1.25 release.

2005-05-02 22:17  rbt

	* zigzag.dia.tmpl: Prevent Dia 0.94 from crashing by rearranging
	  the Dependency attributes.

2005-05-02 22:07  rbt

	* dia.tmpl, zigzag.dia.tmpl: Eliminate Dia warnings for newer
	  versions of dia (new elements).

	  Luckily, Dia will completely ignore these saved values and
	  calculate it's own instead which is convenient because we really
	  have no idea where to place things.

2005-05-01 01:32  rbt

	* Makefile, neato.tmpl: Template for the Neato and Twopi tools
	  (part of GraphViz) submitted by Tony Wasson.

2005-05-01 01:13  rbt

	* postgresql_autodoc.pl: Finish() the GetVersion sql statement.

	  Set the FK Group number back to being a number instead of the
	  schema name. Accidentally converted earlier while removing the
	  $group variable.

2005-05-01 01:07  rbt

	* dot.tmpl: Matt Bosworth has provided an updated dot template with
	  PK, FK information and improved styling.

	  Rod proceeded to break several things, but eventually got it
	  working again.

2005-04-18 19:53  rbt

	* postgresql_autodoc.pl: Fix GraphViz foreign key links (they were
	  missing).

2005-04-18 19:48  rbt

	* zigzag.dia.tmpl:
	  The latest version of dia crashes when I open a dia file produced
	  with the zigzag.dia.tmpl template. I replaced the following lines
	  in zigzag.dia.tmpl

	  <dia:point val="0.0,0.0"/>

	  with

	  <dia:point val="1.0,1.0"/>

	  and dia no longer crashes.

	  best whishes,  Piebe de Vries

2005-02-27 14:39  rbt

	* postgresql_autodoc.pl: Bump copyright date.

2005-02-27 14:38  rbt

	* postgresql_autodoc.pl: Do a little bit of cleaning on this old
	  and crufty code.

2005-02-27 13:08  rbt

	* postgresql_autodoc.pl: Include argument names as provided by
	  Jacob Smullyan.

	  Clean up handling of argument types from a schema not in the
	  current path. This means getting rid of the schema prefix added
	  by format_type so when can add our own when appropriate.

2004-10-13 09:46  rbt

	* ChangeLog, postgresql_autodoc.pl: Push out 1.24

2004-10-12 09:33  rbt

	* postgresql_autodoc.pl: Strip out quotes in the comparison area.

2004-06-29 12:40  rbt

	* dia.tmpl, postgresql_autodoc.pl, zigzag.dia.tmpl: From:
	  Bort, Paul Subject:	  RE: Patch for Dia templates for
	  Postgresql_AutoDoc Date:	  Tue, 22 Jun 2004 15:23:24 -0400

	  I've used the same method of shortening as the constraint you
	  mentioned, but I made it a new entry (table_comment_dia) in the
	  hash rather than mangle the existing one. I tried to follow the
	  existing naming conventions and coding style. I picked a total of
	  45 characters because that seems to be about the right size on my
	  screen. In testing I also found a bug in Dia that causes a crash
	  if a comment is too long, but that seems to be in the 100+
	  character range, so I'm not worried about 45.

	  Here are the patches for postgresql_autodoc.pl, dia.tmpl, and
	  zigzag.dia.tmpl.

2004-06-02 21:46  rbt

	* ChangeLog, postgresql_autodoc.pl: 1.23 Release

2004-06-01 11:22  rbt

	* postgresql_autodoc.pl: Handle the inability to connect to the
	  database (print real error message).

	  Use pg_get_constraintdef() for 7.4 and newer databases.
	  PostgreSQL does the formatting all by itself now.
